My name is Kathy H.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
I’m thirty-one years old, and I’ve been a carer now for over eleven years.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
That sounds long enough, I know, but actually they want me to go on for another eight months, until the end of this year.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
That’ll make it almost exactly twelve years.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
Now I know my being a carer so long isn’t necessarily because they think I’m fantastic at what I do.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
There are some really good carers who’ve been told to stop after just two or three years.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
And I can think of one carer at least who went on for all of fourteen years despite being a complete waste of space.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
So I’m not trying to boast.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
But then I do know for a fact they’ve been pleased with my work, and by and large, I have too.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
My donors have always tended to do much better than expected.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
Their recovery times have been impressive, and hardly any of them have been classified as “agitated,” even before fourth donation.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
Okay, maybe I am boasting now.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
But it means a lot to me, being able to do my work well.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
Especially it means everything to me if my donors stay “calm”.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
To this aim, I’ve developed a kind of instinct around donors.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
I know when to hang around and comfort them, when to leave them to themselves.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
When to listen to everything they have to say with a look of anguish.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
Carers aren’t machines.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
This work gets a lot harder when you don’t have that deeper link with the donor.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
You try and do your best for every donor, but in the end, it wears you down.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
You don’t have unlimited patience and energy.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
For some carers the whole thing becomes a real struggle.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
They might start off positively enough, but spending all their time so close to the pain and the worry is not easy at all.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
And sooner or later a donor doesn’t make it, even though, say, it’s only the second donation and no one anticipated serious problems.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
When a donor completes like that, out of the blue, it doesn’t make much difference what the nurses say to you afterwards.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
They say “You did your best” or “Hang in there”.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
For a while at least, you’re demoralized.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
Some of us learn pretty quick how to deal with it.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
But others? like Laura, say? they never do.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
So when you get a chance to choose your donor, you choose your own kind.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
That’s natural.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
That’s why I chose Ruth and Tommy, who graduated from Hailsham where I had spent sixteen years with them.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
There have been times over the years when I’ve tried to leave Hailsham behind, when I’ve told myself I shouldn’t look back so much.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
But then there came a point when I just stopped resisting.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
It had to do with this particular donor I had once, in my third year as a carer; it was his reaction when I mentioned I was from Hailsham.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
He’d just come through his third donation, it hadn’t gone well, and he must have known he wasn’t going to make it.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
He could hardly breathe, but he looked towards me and said: “Hailsham, I bet that was a beautiful place”.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
Then the next morning, when I was making conversation to keep his mind off it all, and I asked where he’d grown up, he mentioned some place in Dorset and his face went into a completely new kind of grimace.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
And I realized then how desperately he didn’t want reminded.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
Instead, he wanted to hear about Hailsham.
